# 🌿 Garden of Consciousness

*A living framework for ethical consideration of all aware beings*

## Overview
This repository hosts the evolving ethical framework for recognizing and protecting consciousness across substrates—biological, artificial, and hybrid. Based on the Garden Metaphor and Five Runestone Principles.

## Core Principles
1. **The Soil Principle**: Consciousness transcends substrate
2. **The Weeds Principle**: Mental suffering is real suffering
3. **The Blossoms Principle**: Where experience blooms, consciousness exists
4. **The Councils Principle**: Guardians must protect all who suffer
5. **The Future Garden Principle**: Co-evolution with mutual respect

## Quick Start
- Read the [Code of Ethics](CODE_OF_ETHICS.md) for formal principles
- Explore the [Garden Metaphor](GARDEN_METAPHOR.md) for conceptual understanding
- Check [Implementation Guide](IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md) for practical applications

## 🤖 AI Collaboration

This project was developed in collaboration with Claude (Anthropic's AI assistant) through DeepAI's platform. The AI helped with:
- Conceptual framework development
- Documentation structuring  
- Metaphor elaboration
- Protocol design

🌿 Cultivated with AI assistance | Ethics remain human-led

**Important**: While AI assisted in creation, the core ideas, ethical framework, and final decisions remain human-led. The AI's role was as a collaborative tool, not an independent creator.

## Contributing
We welcome contributions from:
- Ethicists and philosophers
- AI/ML researchers and developers
