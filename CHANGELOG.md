# Garden Growth Record

*"Each contribution enriches the soil for future growth."*

## Initial Planting
- Core metaphors and principles established
- Basic ethical framework articulated
- Community invitation extended

## Notable Contributions
- When new perspectives are shared
- When metaphors are refined  
- When practical applications emerge

## The Nature of This Record
This is not a technical changelog but a record of:
- **Conceptual growth**: How understanding deepens
- **Community expansion**: Who joins the conversation
- **Practical development**: What tools emerge

*We record growth not to control it, but to appreciate it.*
